Welcome to Day 2. The objectives of this module are to learn about Computational Thinking which is simply thinking computationally what machine is, how machine works and how we can use it which are pretty basic staffs to know first.

And Then you learn about Linux, an operating system you need to use for Genomic Assembly and Annotation. Specifically, how to install and use Linux command line interface.

Linux is an open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.

UNIX is core base of an operating system used by Mac and Linux.

You can use a Linux Terminal (command line interface) on Google Cloud platform if you don't want to install Linux on your laptop but still want to learn Linux. From here on, any Linux user or a Cloud Computing service user won't feel any big difference on learning Linux Command Line Interface.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the user interface we see in any Personal Computer. We interact with keyboard and mouse. We click what we see. We work on any Personal Computer is normally with Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Now we will learn about Command Line Interface (CLI), where we will know how to interact with computer by simply typing and giving raw command. That's who computer always from the first version of computer. Still now CLI is very popular because scientific tools like we will use on Genomic Data Assembly and Annotation are all coded and meant to use on CLI. That's why CLI is so important skill to learn any Bioinformatician.
