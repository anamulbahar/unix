# First create a directory where u want to mount it.

sudo mkdir /media/windows

# Now you have to find which partition is the NTFS one by using:

sudo fdisk -l

# If your NTFS partition is for example /dev/sdb1 to mount it use:

sudo mount -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222 /dev/sdb1 /media/windows

# To unmount simply do:

sudo umount /media/windows
